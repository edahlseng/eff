Eff
===

An extensible effect monad.

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/edahlseng/eff/tree/master.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/edahlseng/eff/tree/master)

Eff is a container for effects. It separates effects into two parts – a description of what needs to be done, and the logic to make it happen. These individual parts can be combined with other effects, creating applications that are much easier to understand, test, and maintain.

Motivation
----------

Composition is the pinnacle of reusability for software. While easy to achieve when working with pure functions, the reality is that any useful application necessarily produces _effects_, and are by definition impure, making composition much more difficult. The Eff monad allows for these "impure" applications to easily utilize composition by splitting effects into two separate pieces – the definition of an effect, and the interpretation of an effect – each of which can be composed.

Documentation
-------------

Eff is available on NPM. To install:

```shell
npm install eff
```

To use:

```JavaScript
import { pure, send, run, ... } from 'eff';
```

For an introduction to working with Eff, see the example below. A detailed API reference can be found in the [`documentation/` directory](./documentation/).

Example
-------

This library comes with several different effects already defined, though custom effects can be easily written. This example uses the `FileSystem` effects to read from a file, uppercase all of its content, and then write a new file with the transformed content.

The first step is to write the application as a definition of the effects that will be performed:

```JavaScript
import { FileSystem, run } from "eff";

const upperCase = str => str.toUpperCase();

const application =
	FileSystem.readFile("./a.txt")
	.map(upperCase)
	.chain(FileSystem.writeFile("./b.txt"));
```

The application as written above will not actually _do_ anything, it's just a _description of what should be done_. The magic comes from interpreting this description:

```JavaScript
import { run } from "eff";

// In the line below the application is interpreted. This is when the effects are actually run.
run([FileSystem.interpretLocalFileSystem("/home/me")])(() => console.log("Done!"))(application)
```

The interpreter contains two different parts:
* `FileSystem.interpretLocalFileSystem`: This is the standard `FileSystem` effect interpreter.
* `run`: This is the main `Eff` interpreter. It is always needed to properly interpret an Eff monad.

At first blush this separation of effects into a definition and its interpretation may seem inconsequential. Nevertheless, this approach gives us extremely powerful abilities that go beyond just separation of concerns:
* trivial testability
* composition of _applications_

Let's take a closer look at the first one, testability, in action:

```JavaScript
let fileSystem = { "/home/me/a.txt": "hello, world" };

run([
	FileSystem.interpretMockFileSystem({
		workingDirectory: "/home/me",
		startingFileSystem: fileSystem,
		onUpdate: newFileSystem => {
			fileSystem = newFileSystem;
		}
	})
])(mockFileSystemOutput => {
	if (mockFileSystemOutput["/home/me/b.txt"] === "HELLO, WORLD") {
		console.log("Test passed!");
	} else {
		console.log("Test failed!");
	}
})(application);
```

We can interpret the application definition with a mock interpreter just as easily as the original interpreter. This allows us to verify the logic of the application without needing to actually interact with a live file system.
